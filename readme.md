# 📝 Enhanced Word Match Game

An improved version of the classic word-matching game. It features multiple words, a timer, a score system, and an infinite mode where words keep coming back to challenge your typing skills!

## 🎯 Objective

Type the word shown on the screen. If you type it correctly, the next word will appear. The game continues infinitely with new words and keeps track of your time and score.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple words**: A set of words to type.
- **Infinite Mode**: After finishing the list, the game starts again with the first word.
- **Timer**: The time you’ve spent playing is tracked.
- **Scoreboard**: Keeps count of how many words you typed correctly.
- **Live input feedback**: Get instant feedback as you type.

## 🧠 Logic

1. The game starts with the first word.
2. As you type the word correctly, your score increases, and the next word is displayed.
3. When all words are completed, the game continues with the first word again, keeping the game **infinite**.
4. You can track your **time** (in seconds) and **score** (number of correct words typed).
